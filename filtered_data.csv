The Selway River drainage comprises the southern limit of the known range in Idaho (Wilson 1990) and Copper Creek and the Moyie River drainage the northern limit (Wilson et al. 1989).

Two of the three occupied (extant) sites have good viability (Mountain Slough, Aggasiz and Maria Slough, Aggasiz) although these sites may be altered in the future by natural succession caused by the rapid growth of the exotic reed canary grass (<i>Phalaris arundinacae</i>). The third occupied site (Maintenance Detachment Aldergrove, Langley) has poor viability and is rapidly declining due to a combination of hydrological dysfunction, exotic plants and animals and succession.

On Vancouver Island, where the majority of the population is currently found, populations within large provincial parks and reserves such as Strathcona, Goldstream, and Clayoquot Sound are probably secure, but rescue effects are limited. Parks likely protect EOs, but the continued practice of fish stocking in Provincial parks could negatively impact Red-legged Frog populations (Wind, in progress). Ovaska and Sopuck (2004) state that 13% of Vancouver Island, 3.6% of the Sunshine Coast is protected from this, it is estimated that less than 10% of the species' Canadian range is protected and managed effectively.",SC,,01-May-15,1,12-Jan-05,,SC,Y  ,"Monitor Trend, Status Rpt, COSEWIC, Plan, Hab Protect, Species Mgmt, Private Land, Hab Restore",15-Mar-10,D2,H,,Rana aurora,1,,26/03/2021

They breed in shallow, littoral zones of lakes, temporary and permanent pools and wetlands, bogs and fens, and roadside ditches (i.e., toads may be found in all lacustrine and palustrine habitats); tadpoles associate with benthic habitats. In northern BC and the Yukon, Western Toads have been observed using geothermal springs and surrounding tufa/soils for breeding and hibernacula (Slough 2004). In addition, like many amphibian species, toads utilize riparian areas. Lotic habitats with little to no flow are suitable for toads. Small, moist depressions may be used for reydration (toads can absorb water through their 'pelvic patch') (Green and Campbell 1984; Davis 2000). Toads utilize a variety of terrestrial habitats in BC, including all forest and woodland types, shrubland/chaparral, savanna, cropland/hedgerow, grassland/herbaceous cover, old fields, and suburban/orchard. Hibernacula are located in areas with loose soils and burrows. Toads have been observed using downed wood for cover in recent clearcuts (E. Wind, pers. comm.). Western Toads one of few amphibians found at high elevations (> 3,000 m). Climate change may impact western toads in northern regions of BC where populations are dependent on areas of high snow accumulation, that lack permafrost, to survive through winter (Cook 1977).",S4,31-Dec-16,31/12/2016,3,01-Jan-05,G4,15-Oct-01,03-Jan-08,Yellow,BC = High - medium,F = Decline of 10-30%,No long-term monitoring has taken place.,U = Unknown,No long-term monitoring has taken place.,E = > 300,"G = 100,000 - 1,000,000 individuals","G = 200,000-2,500,000 square km",,"The range extends along the Pacific Coast from southern Alaska (Wiedmer and Hodge 1996) to Baja California, and eastward through the Rocky Mountains to west-central Alberta, Montana (Werner et al. 2004), Wyoming (Baxter and Stone 1985), Utah (Ross et al. 1995, Thompson et al. 2004), Colorado (Hammerson 1999), and (formerly) northern New Mexico (Degenhardt et al. 1996).

The species can appear very common or abundant due to the mass metamorph groups that are encountered in late summer, but adults and breeding sites may be rare (i.e., patchy distribution) (Wind and Dupuis 2002; Slough 2004; E. Wind, pers. comm.). As well, populations in the Lower Mainland, Vancouver Island, and in the U.S.have declined or been extirpated, even in pristine areas where declines may be difficult to detect (Wind and Dupuis 2002).","Several large Provincial and National parks occur within the range of the Western Toad in BC; e.g., Tweedsmuir, Wells Gray, Manning, and Strathcona Provincial Parks, and the Rocky Mountain National Parks. However, because the cause of the toad declines remain unknown, the protection of land alone may not protect the species from the effects of disease, climate change, etc. For example, declines have been observed in a national park in AB (Taylor and Smith 2003). The continued practice of fish stocking in BC's Provincial parks could negatively impact toad populations, especially as it pertains to disease issues in amphibians and toads in particular (Wind, in review).",SC,,30-Nov-12,1,13-Jun-18,Calling and Non-calling Populations,SC,N  ,"Monitor Trend, Status Rpt, Plan, Hab Protect, Hab Restore, Private Land, Species Mgmt",18-Aug-09,,M,,Anaxyrus boreas,1,,26/03/2021
